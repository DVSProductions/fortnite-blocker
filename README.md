This is the modified Code of my now dead Bot Fortnite Blocker. Have fun using it...

## Installation
Download everything and edit the index.js.<br>
Change the Bot token and the game you want to detect.<br>
After that run:
```js
npm i
```
to download all packages.<br>
Then just run the bot with node.<br>
Have fun!
